#### Technical articles

- In "[modern attacks on the Chrome browser : optimizations and deoptimizations](https://doar-e.github.io/blog/2020/11/17/modern-attacks-on-the-chrome-browser-optimizations-and-deoptimizations/)" I explain a bug that allowed to trick the deoptimizer into materializing a fake object
- In "[circumventing Chrome's hardening of typer bugs](https://doar-e.github.io/blog/2019/05/09/circumventing-chromes-hardening-of-typer-bugs/)" I discuss a protection added to bound check elimination and how I bypassed it
- Wrote an [introduction to Turbofan](https://doar-e.github.io/blog/2019/01/28/introduction-to-turbofan/), a component of Chrome's JS engine (V8) responsible for optimizations
- I was the first to publish about using the [self-referencing PML4 technique](https://labs.f-secure.com/archive/windows-8-kernel-memory-protections-bypass/) in Windows kernel exploits
- I made a write-up on exploiting [MS10-058](https://doar-e.github.io/blog/2014/03/11/first-dip-into-the-kernel-pool-ms10-058/) when I was a student
- I wrote several articles in French for the magazine [MISC](https://connect.ed-diamond.com/auteur/Fetiveau-Jeremy)

#### Talks

- My [Infiltrate 2020](http://www.infiltratecon.net/conference/speakers/jeremy-fetiveau.html) talk on chrome is postponed to 2021. Hopefuly it'll be an in-person event!
- I gave my first chrome talk at [TyphoonCon Seoul](https://doar-e.github.io/presentations/typhooncon2019/AttackingTurboFan_TyphoonCon_2019.pdf) in 2019!
- This is a [presentation I gave in France](https://github.com/JeremyFetiveau/Talks/blob/master/LowFragmentationHeap_Win7_RSSIL.pdf) after my second year of university ... in 2012
